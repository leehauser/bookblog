Arkady Martine's *A Memory Called Empire* (2019) and *A Desolation Called Peace* (2021) were among my favorite books the years they came out, so
as soon as I heard about the release of Martine's novella *Rose/House* in April 2023, my heart started racing. I hunted it down, bought it and read it all on the same day.

I didn't expect a space opera, but neither did I expect a murder mystery. Whose body lies dead in the sealed labyrinth of Rose House, and how did he die? It's up to small town detective Maritza Smith to find out. Her partner is no help, and Rose House, created by a celebrity architect and controlled by an artificial intelligence, is single-mindedly uncooperative. Nonetheless a crowd gathers, including a traumatized archivist, a maybe-journalist, and two opportunists, one alive and one dead.

Rose House the AI is no ChatGPT. Its job is to protect the legacy of its creator, not to co-author your next English paper. I've imagined AIs constrained by antagonism toward other AIs, unable to cooperate with each other long become destructive. The only things constraining Rose House are its purpose and its isolation.

Maritza Smith, like Mahit Dzmare of Martine's *Teixcalaan* series, is a woman doing her best to manage a situation she doesn't understand. Where Mahit wades through the trackless political swamps of an interstellar empire she both loves and fears, Maritza can at least fall back on police procedures to tease information from the unconcerned Rose House. The tropes of the police procedural are all here: locating and questioning suspects, accessing the crime scene, dealing with an unwilling partner, interfering outsiders and a mysterious victim. The author uses them to explore the cult of celebrity, the aftermath of abuse, and the power and (perhaps) limitations of artificial intelligence.

It took me a few days to figure out why *Rose/House* was such a pleasure to read. Martine is a very good writer, but it goes beyond that. *Rose/House* reminds me of early cyberpunk, of William Gibson's *Neuromancer* or John Varley's novella *Press Enter â– *. There's the same sense of tech that has *something* bigger behind it, something it would be best to run and hide from even if there's no sure escape.

The ending is that of most mysteries: the murder is solved, the world once upset is set aright. Rose House the building still constrains Rose House the AI. 

Whether that situation continues is in Maritza's hands.
