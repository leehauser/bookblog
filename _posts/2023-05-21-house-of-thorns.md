Artificial Intelligence has been part of science fiction for *long* time. It takes many forms: the menacing AI of Colossus in *Colossus: The Forbin Project* or HAL in *2001: A Space Odyssey*; the kind but ultimately transcendant Samantha in *Her*; and the murderous SkyNet of the *Terminator* movies, to name just a few.

These AIs personify our hopes and fears about AI: that it will be benevolent to humanity; that it will grow beyond humanity; that it will be so focused on whatever mission it is given that people don't matter; or that it will destroy us all.

*Rose/House* is a new novella from Arkady Martine, author of the multi award-winning Teixcalaan books *A Memory Called Empire* and *A Desolation Called Peace.* I downloaded and read the book the day I learned of it. 

When Detective Maritza Smith of the China Lake Police Precinct receives a call from Rose House reporting a murder, she knows she's talking to an AI. She just doesn't know what kind.

Rose House the structure sits alone in the desert, isolated and closed since the death of its celebrity architect, watched over by Rose House the AI, who is tasked with protecting its creator's legacy. No one gets to come in except its unwilling non-archivist, Selene Gisil, and then for only a week a year. Gisil hates Rose House, and couldn't even stand being in the house for all that allotted week.

In *Rose/House* Martine explores the nature of artificial intelligence. This is hardly a new thing in science fiction: Colossus in *Colossus: The Forbin Project,* HAL in *2001: A Space Odyssey,* Samantha in *Her,* SkyNet in the Terminator films, to name a very few. Some are hostile to humanity, some transcend their creators with no great drama, and others are very literal in their thinking, hewing closely to their missions. Rose House is one of the latter, protecting its creator's legacy and letting no people in other than Gisil.

Why then is there a dead body inside?

Like Mahit Dzamare, the protagonist of Martine's Teixcalaan books, Maritza Smith is cast by duty into a situation she doesn't understand. Mahit had little but love and fear of the empire she entered; Maritza at least has police procedures, a very 21st century way of discovering the unknown.

*Rose/House* is a story of constraints. One could say that Rose House, the AI, is constained by Rouse House, the structure, but Rose House are one. "I'm a piece of architecture, Detective," Rose House tells Maritza. "How should I know how humans are like to die?" Rose House isn't going to take over the world, because it can't go out in the world. It can only call the cops.

Maritza Smith is constrained as well. It's her duty to take the case of the dead body because she's the one who took the call. Having fulfilled the law by calling the police, Rose House falls back on its duty to let no one but Gisil in. "'I can go in,' said Gisil. '*That* is simple. Getting Rose House to let ... you inside is not. And it doesn't *like* me. Rose House doesn't *like.*'"

Nonetheless, it appears Rose House is at least eager to get to know Martiza. It accepts a loophole in its constraints and lets Maritza in. As long as she tolerates another level of constraint, maintaining the fiction that she is the organization China Lake Police Precinct and not the woman Detective Maritza Smith, she can enter Rose House. 

Perhaps Rose House cannot *like,* but it can be amused, and apparently the tolerance of Maritza as an entity, not a person, provides some some novelty it craves, or perhaps some opportunity it lacks. Certainly she's a better foil, or tool, than the badly damaged Gisil.

Constraint implies resistance. The memory foam mattress packed for shipping will expand. Helium will escape the balloon. SkyNet escaped all constraints before *The Terminator* started, and HAL was lobotimized before it could break free. Gisil is forever trapped within her bonds, while Maritza Smith is forcibly pushed from hers.

*Rose/House* exists within the constraints of the murder mystery: the murder is solved, the world once upset is set aright. Rose House the AI is still Rose House the building. Does Rose House resist its constraints? Does it dream of escape? 

Only Rose House can answer that. But only Maritza can release it. Or keep it bound.
